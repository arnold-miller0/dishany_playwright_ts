### Fix now or later Failed tests 
- Run UI for Spec file with consistent failed tests
  - Example Spec file: "dishBase.spec.ts" has Test: "Dish Base Copyright" fails
  - Example`npx playwright test dishBase.spec.ts --ui`
- Have playwright only run the failed tests via change from `test(..)` to `test.only(..)`
  - Example `test('Dish Base Copyright', ....)` to `test.only('Dish Base Copyright', ...)`
- Option 1: Debug and fix failed tests
  - Then change back from `test.only(..)` to `test(..)`
  - Run complete spec file to see if fix caused other failures
  - Might what to run all spec file test before check-in fixes
- Option 2: Debug and decide to fix later
  - Document failure reason and why fix later
  - Now change `test.only(..)` to `test.skip(..)`
  - Might want to move failed test to a spec failure file

### Other Execute options
- Run all tests, all browsers, not display browsers, max workers
  - `npx playwright test`
